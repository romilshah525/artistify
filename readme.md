# Artistify
Artistify is a Deep Learning based Web Application, that helps simulate the concept of [Neural Style Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_Style_Transfer) in Deep Learning.


## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to simulate the idea of Neural Style Transfer using Deep Learning, using Tensorflow(Python) for deep learning script and flask for web app.

## Project Status: Completed

## Getting Started

1. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/romilshah525/artistify) (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Make sure all the necesary dependencies are installed, conda is preffered.
3. Go to the project folder and run 'flask run' or 'python main.py' in your terminal. The flask server will start at http://127.0.0.1:5000/, by defualt.
4. Upload content and style images, and monitor the progress in the track bar.
5. Once the image is generated, all the three images will be shown.
